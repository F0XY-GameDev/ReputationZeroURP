  Text: 'The letter reads: "Dear Alexandra, we were saddened to hear of your father''s
    passing and offer our condolences. However, we must inform you that we intend
    to contest the inheritance that you have received. As Reginald''s direct descendants,
    we believe that we are entitled to a greater share of the Thistle family fortune
    than we were given. We urge you to consider our claim and come to a fair and
    equitable resolution. We hope that this matter can be resolved amicably and without
    the need for legal action. Sincerely, Pierce and Hawthorne Thistle."'
