  Text: 'The letter reads: "To my dearest J, I love you with all my heart and soul,
    but I must make a difficult decision to protect my inheritance as a contested
    heiress to the Thistle family fortune. The Thistle name has been associated with
    wealth and power for generations, and I cannot risk losing it all for the sake
    of love. I will always cherish the time we spent together, but for now, I must
    say goodbye. -Yours in Heart and Soul Forever, Alexandra"'
